This code converts Chirp export file in CSV format to Yaesu's import CSV format.

At this point it's very buggy and horrible. I need to make it better. Soon...

Don't use this code. It might blow up your system. You have been warned!

#TODO

- Add better csv writing
- So far only Tone mode is supported, add DTCS, etc...
- Better error handling
- Better code commenting
